## Introduction

CyberLens is designed to assist cybersecurity professionals in their analysis process by providing detailed visualizations of network traffic, attack vectors, and threats. The application allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources to identify security risks and make informed decisions.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visual representation of cybersecurity data with real-time updates.
- **Threat Detection**: Visualize active and resolved threats, providing analysts with the ability to act quickly.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Receive recent alerts about suspicious activities or potential threats.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate and analyze charts for network traffic and attack vector distributions.
- **Reports**: View detailed security reports and generate new analysis for ongoing investigations.
- **User Management**: Features for user login, profile management, and settings.
